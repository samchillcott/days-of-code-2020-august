**Today's Progress**
- N/A.

**Thoughts** 
- Day off outside the house. Definitely feel better being away from devices and code. Fresh air also helps. Been minimally active this month. Still trying to find the balance but getting there.

**Today's Progress**
- Updated readme for Gulp project. Now all repos have detailed notes.

**Thoughts** 
- Day off.
- Taking time out to do Sunday morning routine of coffee, jazz and reading. 
- Read up on blockchain and its potential. Really intrigued and plan to look into both the core tech and where I could potentially utilise it.

**Today's Progress**⁣
- Challenge 7 - Tests:⁣
- Prepping Coaching Question App for testing by refactoring some of the functions to pure functions (no side effects) to be able to unit test. ⁣
- Optimised and condensed code to less lines and fewer functions.⁣
- Added hover state to button and fixed width so now the button is mobile responsive (was breaking out of container previously on some models).⁣
- Removed official twitter styling so functionality and hide on start now both work.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Caught myself spending time fixing other things on the app (not what I should be doing atm).⁣
- I'm struggling to understand the code for 2 reasons: I wrote this ages ago and didn't really use explanatory function and variable names and I modelled the code on a SO suggestion and still don't fully understand one aspect of it (I got it working and that's all that mattered at the time). One of things on my todo list was to look at an alternative/more efficient way of writing the logic in this app and I can see why now.⁣
- My top value is Discomfort at the moment. I'm really feeling it looking at this code but leaning into it as I know this is where I shall grow/improve.⁣
- My code is bloated and I am struggling to figure out what I can remove/refactor.⁣
- The fear of breaking stuff kicked in again. Reminded myself I'm on a new branch, chill out, go play.⁣
- I've figured how to make the app way simpler, just having scope issues on one of the variables. Fixed.⁣
- Not actually done the pure function but have improved other areas of app (which I guess does actually go some way to prepping for testing (and testing for performance)).⁣
- Quick chat with mentor getting head around pure functions and testing philosophy. Will attack tomorrow.⁣
- Official twitter button was injecting an iframe which caused issues with styling/hiding and carrying state to tweet. Did it my way instead.
